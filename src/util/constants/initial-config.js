	ABOUT_ME_HTML: `
Hi, my name is Eric Stiles. All photos from this site have been taken and edited by
me. Whether it’s the long exposure blur of car head lights and ferris wheels, the
reflection of Chicago, or the bright stars of Zion Nation Park, I typically like to
focus on the lights in an image.
<br /><br />
Aside from sharing and selling my photos, I like having them as a reminder of all
the adventures and sites I have had the privilege to experience and see. Living in
Chicago has been such a great experience so far and I cannot wait to share more of
my photos with all of you. I also don’t intend to stop traveling anytime soon, so
expect to see some variety in new locations. Thank you for visiting this site and
checking out my photos! Please reach out to me with any questions or comments that
you may have at
